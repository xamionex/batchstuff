# terrible code i randomly make in batch/ps1 for no reason

### phone.bat
downloads scrcpy and vdesk for use
- phone silent: launches cmd in background
- phone vr: launches with vdesk and switches the scrcpy window to 2nd virtual desktop
- phone silentvr: calls silent then vr
- phone kill: kills adb and scrcpy
- phone update_scrcpy: redownloads scrcpy
- phone update_vdesk: redownloads vdesk

### NMI.ps1
bad code for making all minecraft instances linked, to be used with prismlauncher \
running from console as 
 - `NMI.ps1 "path\to\instance\"`
 - `NMI.ps1 "C:\Users\Petar\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\instances\Versatile"`
